discrepancies(v1 :: LatticePoint{T}, v2 :: LatticePoint{T}, t :: Rational{T}) where {T <: Integer}

A modified version of computing the discrepancies of a two-dimensional cone
which takes an additional parameter `t`. See the `discrepancies` function from
RationalPolygons.jl for the original.

The discrepancy of an element `w` of the hilbert basis of `v1` and `v2` is
defined to be the quotient of the length of `w` by the length of the
intersection point between the ray going through `w` and the line going through
`v1` and `v2`. Here, we add an additional parameter `t`, which modifies this to take the line through `t*v1` and `v2` instead. Hence, for `t = 1`, this behaves
exactly like the unaltered `discrepancies` function.

This extra functionality is needed for computing the discrepancies of elliptic
fixed points of C*-surfaces.
